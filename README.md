I'm a full-stack development student currently enrolled in Micorverse, an online software development school that uses pair-programming and real-world projects to teach development.
I learned HTML/CSS and JavaScript. I enjoy listening to music, play videogames and code. My goal this year is to finish Microverse program and land a job.
